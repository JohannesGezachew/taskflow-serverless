# Deployment Verification

Post-deployment testing and validation checklist.

## Infrastructure Validation

### Core Services
- [ ] DynamoDB table `TodoItems` active
- [ ] Lambda functions deployed and configured
- [ ] API Gateway endpoints responding
- [ ] S3 bucket configured for static hosting
- [ ] CloudFront distribution deployed

### IAM & Security
- [ ] Lambda execution role has DynamoDB permissions
- [ ] API Gateway CORS configured correctly
- [ ] S3 bucket policy allows public read access
- [ ] CloudFront origin access configured

## Functional Testing

### API Endpoints
- [ ] `GET /todos` returns 200 with empty array
- [ ] `POST /todos` creates new todo item
- [ ] `PUT /todos/{id}` updates existing todo
- [ ] `DELETE /todos/{id}` removes todo item
- [ ] All endpoints return proper CORS headers

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] Static website loads without errors
- [ ] API calls succeed from frontend
- [ ] User session management functional
- [ ] Theme switching operational

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- [ ] API Gateway handles concurrent requests
- [ ] DynamoDB performance within expected limits
- [ ] CloudFront cache hit ratio acceptable
- [ ] Lambda cold start times reasonable

### Security Testing
- [ ] CORS headers prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive data
- [ ] IAM roles follow least-privilege principle

## Monitoring Setup

### CloudWatch Configuration
- [ ] Lambda function logs enabled
- [ ] API Gateway execution logs enabled
- [ ] DynamoDB metrics visible
- [ ] Custom dashboards created

### Alerting
- [ ] Error rate alarms configured
- [ ] Cost budget alerts enabled
- [ ] Performance threshold alerts set
  - [ ] style.css
  - [ ] favicon.svg
- [ ] S3 website endpoint URL copied and saved

### HTTPS Setup (Recommended)
- [ ] CloudFront distribution created
- [ ] Origin configured to use S3 website endpoint
- [ ] Distribution deployed (wait 5-15 minutes)
- [ ] CloudFront HTTPS URL copied and saved
- [ ] Test HTTPS access works

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Custom favicon displays correctly
- [ ] Can create new todos
- [ ] Can view existing todos
- [ ] Can mark todos as complete/incomplete
- [ ] Can delete todos (check CORS is working)
- [ ] User session management works
- [ ] Theme switching works (dark/light mode)
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] User indicator shows user ID (not "Loading...")

### API Tests
- [ ] GET /todos returns user's todos
- [ ] POST /todos creates new todo
- [ ] PUT /todos/{id} updates existing todo
- [ ] DELETE /todos/{id} removes todo (no CORS errors)
- [ ] CORS headers present in all responses
- [ ] Error handling works properly

### Performance & Security
- [ ] API responses are fast (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] HTTPS enabled via CloudFront
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Global CDN performance (test from different locations)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- [ ] CORS errors â†’ Check API Gateway CORS configuration and redeploy
- [ ] 502 errors â†’ Check Lambda function logs in CloudWatch
- [ ] DynamoDB access errors â†’ Verify IAM role permissions
- [ ] Frontend not loading â†’ Check S3 bucket policy and static hosting config
- [ ] DELETE button not working â†’ Enable CORS for DELETE method specifically
- [ ] "Loading..." stuck â†’ Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Monitoring
- [ ] CloudWatch logs accessible for Lambda functions
- [ ] API Gateway request/response logging enabled
- [ ] DynamoDB metrics visible in CloudWatch
- [ ] CloudFront metrics available (if using)

## Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Custom domain configured with Route 53
- [ ] SSL certificate from ACM for custom domain
- [ ] WAF rules configured for security
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms set up for monitoring
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented for DynamoDB
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline set up for automated deployments

## Documentation & GitHub
- [ ] README updated with live URLs
- [ ] Architecture diagram created
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Deployment guide tested and verified
- [ ] LICENSE file added
- [ ] .gitignore file configured
- [ ] Repository ready for GitHub upload

## Final URLs
- [ ] **HTTP URL**: `http://your-bucket.s3-website.region.amazonaws.com`
- [ ] **HTTPS URL**: `https://your-distribution.cloudfront.net`
- [ ] **API URL**: `https://your-api.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/prod`
